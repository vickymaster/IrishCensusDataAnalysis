# IrishCensusDataAnalysis
Data analysis of 2016 Irish Census Data using Python as the data programming language.

The 2016 Irish Census Data has been divided into 15 Themes, each measuring a different population parameter. The selected themes of interest considered for the case study are :

1) Migration, Ethnicity, Religion and Foreign Languages
2) Irish Language
3) Families
4) Education

The project consists of 2 major parts : Exploratory Data Analysis and Statistical Analysis.

Under EDA, I have analyzed different tables in the dataset, performed data visualization and derived some meaningful inferences from these plots. Under Statistical Analysis, I tried to identify Linear Relationship between few parameters using Ordinary Least Squares regression technique. This is followed by performing Hypothesis Testing and finally testing for the assumptions of Linear Regression.

This project helped me to gain great insight from the data anaylsis aspect and I came up with some meaningful conclusions regarding the Irish Census Data.
